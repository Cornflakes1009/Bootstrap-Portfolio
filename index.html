                            <strong>My early life: </strong>I was born in the late 1980's in a small country hospital in central
                            Illinois. I grew up in a town where everyone was a farmer or factory worker. We didn't have any
                            programmers or businesses that even needed them. My school had two technology courses, Office
                            Applications and Visual Basic. I worked retail for 7 years after high scool while attending a
                            local community college for a different major every semester. I knew that wasn't what I wanted
                            to do and I had always liked computers and video games. Then I went on a hunt for a career change.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>My journey into IT: </strong>In 2014, I got on at a dental, medical, and veterinary sales company
                            as a Help Desk Tier I. Over the next 18 months I moved through the ranks and eventually became
                            a Senior Specialist with a specialty is procedure and security. I worked with the security and
                            development teams to implement policies and procedures, but it still wasn't enough. I wanted
                            to make my own apps. I started with free online courses for iOS development and I soon realized
                            that I loved it, but I felt limited to only making apps for the iPhone and iPad. A friend of
                            mine had shown me web development and how he could also make apps for iOS and Android. It was
                            perfect! I could do so much all at once. After that I dove into learning web development, but
                            I found that the over saturation of information was disorienting. I saw an ad for KU's Coding
                            Bootcamp and I knew I had to take it. I got into the bootcamp and I finally moved out of my tiny
                            town in Illinois to an apartment in Kansas City, MO where I live alone and spend all day in front
                            of my computer either working from, doing classwork, or watching Netflix if time allows.</p>
